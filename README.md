we are trying our best to upload the huge scale of our training data, However, this data still faces censorship and network congestion, and we are doing our best to upload it. 

Run run.sh to run our step-by step code, You shoule replace the data path to  your own path. 
you can download GME-7B model and dino-v2 as backbone.
the pipeline is :
1. first using cv_tools dino to recognize the visual keypoints, here you get a visual-keypoints results.
2. train five different parameters expert to vote for both two tasks, the five experts total is a unified model.
3. merge the experts' voting results and  the visual keypoints results to get
The five experts and the dino as a whole can be viewed as a unified model. They are useful for both tasks and do not need to be trained specifically for the task. 
You can download Several dataset by M2KR-train-dataset.
